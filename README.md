# KT2_simulator
Simulator for analysis of different aspects within the miniature game Warhammer 40000 Kill Team

Some disclaimers:
- I am far from a professional developer, just dabbling in Python.
- This is a hobby project which has grown organically without any real plan.
- At the moment the code is fully workable and incorporates a bunch of settings, but it's in an unfinished state with very little optimization and barely cleaned up at all.
- This repository is probably only relevant for people who either a) are playing Games Workshop's miniature wargame Kill Team v. 2.0 or b) want a good laugh at how a home-taught programmer like me is writing code.
